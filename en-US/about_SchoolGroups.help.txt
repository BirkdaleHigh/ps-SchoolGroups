    about_SchoolGroups

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This module is for managing the life cycle of groups and users in the school organization with respect to the MIS in use.

    You will have come and edit this module as there's OU paths coded inside.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    User accounts require a 1:1 mapping from MIS to AD in order to make groups and communication between IT and staff effective.
    This module contains a number of cmdlets to aid in the following goals

    1. Assign each AD record an employeeNumber from the unique record in the MIS
    2. Create new users with a consistently specified format and requirements
    3. Cmdlets to ensure employeeNumber remains unique
    4. Create security groups based on group assignment from a MIS

    This module contains a pre-defined report that can be imported into sims.net as a shortcut to correctly format the data.

    HELPERS
    You want to look at the get-help <command-name> for all of the following, this is an overview;

    Get-IncorrectSimsEmail Easy lookup to find incorrect entries. Does nothing for the rest of the module but handy.
    Get-SchoolUser Wrapper to Get-ADuser to return more school-appropriate fields, used internally too.
    New-Report - runs sims reports o nthe command line for you, even configure your own.
