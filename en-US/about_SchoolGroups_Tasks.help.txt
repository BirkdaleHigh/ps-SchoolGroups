SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Tasks uses the commands from this module to perform functions that are common or require automating.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    There's 2 sides to this module, Overall tasks to perform a job and also each function that is part of that job can be used separately

    TASKS - Praparation
            All users have EmplyeeNumber Applied
        1a. Get-MissingEmployeeNumber
            All enabled accounts have an EmployeeNumber for intake: 2020
        1b. Get-MissingEmployeeNumber -intake 2019
            Incorrect: 3 missing EmployeeNumbers for intake: 2019

        2. See the actual user objects with -passThru `Get-MissingEmployeeNumber -intake 2019 -PassThru`

            DistinguishedName : CN=19LastF,OU=2019,OU=Students,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com
            EmployeeNumber    :
            Enabled           : True
            GivenName         : First
            Name              : 19LastF
            ObjectClass       : user
            ObjectGUID        : XXXX-XX-XX-XX-XXXXX
            SamAccountName    : 19LastF
            SID               : S-1-5-21-XXXXX
            Surname           : Last
            UserPrincipalName : 19LastF@example.com

            So you pipe this to lookup the EmployeeNumber by name from the MIS export from New-Report e.g.

            Get-MissingEmployeeNumber -intake 2019 -PassThru | Search-MISAdmissionNumber

            You get the user object again but this time with the employeeNumber filled in.

        3. Get-MissingEmployeeNumber -intake 2019 -PassThru | Search-MISAdmissionNumber | Update-EmployeeNumber
            Apply that new ID

    TASKS - Normal usage, loosely in order
        New Users
            1a. new-student
            1b. new-staff

        Sync Class Groups
            1. New-Report (update information from sims report)
            2. Sync-Class (Contains Get-Class, Test-Class, New-Class, Remove-Class)

        Sync Class Group Members
            1. New-Report (update information from sims report)

        The Form commands are a mirror of Class except with a different naming & OU pattern.
